Pulse Width Measurement Example Program
=======================================
This example program shows how to compute the width of a pulse
using timer0 in mode 1.  Port 3.2 is used as an external gate
for the timer.  An interrupt is used to accumulate timer overflow.
The width of each pulse is output to the serial port.


To test this program...
-----------------------
1. Start the debugger.
2. View the Serial window.
3. View the Toolbox.
4. Run the program.
5. Click a pulse button to generate a pulse on P3.2.


The width of the pulse generated displays in the serial window
each time you repeat this process.


Be sure to check the debug.ini file to see how the debugger
buttons are created.  A signal function is used to generate
pulses.
